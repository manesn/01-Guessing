# 01-Guessing
For Game Technology, C220 at Indiana University - my first project, for the course and on GitHub and working with Visual Studio in general. A number-guessing game.

As this is my first ever VS Code project, I expect for this project to be potentially riddled with bugs or otherwise hiccups. To that end... if you may find something wrong... welp.

So. A bit of a history about this game, which I call...

"Untitled Nick Game: The Phantom Integer"

... that was lame. It's just a numbers game, okay? I'm a bit tired at the moment. (~ 12:21 AM)

The player gets asked to guess a number between 1 and 100, and has infinite chances to guess away at what the mystery number may be.

If they fall short of said mystery number, the program will tell them that it's wrong, and that the number they guessed is too low.
Likewise, if they guess too high, the program will tell them "o no, the number is too high, try again", and what not.
Failing to put in a number of any sorts gets a funny message.

When they guess the correct number, they get a big smiley sticker and a lollipo- err... no, that's wrong, they get told that they got the correct number right, and how many tries it took for them to get the number.

They are then asked by my fabulous program if they wish to play again, and, assuming they have time (unlike me haha), then all they need to do is say "yes" or "y", and the game will begin again.

Otherwise, the program will end, with a wonderous message from yours truly.

Thank you for taking the time to read this little document thing of mine, and I do hope you give the program a try!
